## Files Modified

### Created Files:
- `src/pages/ManageProducts.tsx` - Admin product management interface

### Updated Files:
- `src/components/Products.tsx` - Now fetches from Firebase
- `src/pages/ProductsPage.tsx` - Already using Firebase
- `src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx` - Already using Firebase

### Existing Files (No Changes Needed):
- `src/data/productsData.ts` - Firebase integration already implemented
- `src/App.tsx` - Routes already configured

## Default Products

The system includes 6 default products:
1. Pulses
2. Grains
3. Spices
4. Oil Seeds
5. Fresh Produce
6. Agro Commodities

These will be automatically initialized in Firebase on first run.

## Important Notes

1. **Product IDs**: Must be unique, lowercase, use hyphens for spaces (e.g., "fresh-produce")
2. **Images**: Use full URLs (consider using a CDN or image hosting service like Unsplash, Cloudinary, etc.)
3. **Firebase**: Products are stored in the `products` collection in Firestore
4. **Design**: The existing design is preserved - no visual changes to public pages
5. **Authentication**: Product management requires admin login

## Accessing Product Management

1. Log in to admin area
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/products/manage`
3. Or use the route map with: `onNavigate("products-manage")`
